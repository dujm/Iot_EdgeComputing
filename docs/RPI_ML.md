[Accelerate Deep Learning Inference on Raspberry Pi
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5niixLtf2Q)
 * This is a demo to show that it is possible to execute Deep Learning Inference at a practical speed by utilizing the full computational power of Raspberry Pi's GPU. All computations are running locally. No networking, no extra accelerator, no numerical approximation on models.
